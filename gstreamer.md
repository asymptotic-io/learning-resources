# GStreamer

* It might help to watch this [talk on GObject](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Q-Av6VTSE), though it is not required as a starting point
* A very high level [introduction to GStreamer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cS_fjM1eNtI)
* The [GStreamer documentation](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/?gi-language=c) is pretty good
  * Start with the tutorials
  * Read the application development manual to flesh it out
  * Read the plugin writer's guide
* A [20 year retrospective on GStreamer](https://gstconf.ubicast.tv/videos/20-years-of-gstreamer_78528/) is not needed, but sets some historical context
